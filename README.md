# Project_001 - Beginner Java Console Applications

This repository contains three beginner-level Java console applications developed as part of my studies in Information Technology and Computer Science. These projects demonstrate foundational programming skills, problem-solving, and logical thinking in Java.

## Projects

### 1. Guess Number Game
- A console-based game where the user guesses a randomly generated number.
- Demonstrates use of variables, loops, conditionals, and the Java Math library.
- Enhances problem-solving and user interaction skills.

### 2. Math Quiz
- A Java console application that quizzes the user with basic math questions.
- Evaluates answers and provides feedback.
- Showcases handling user input, conditional logic, and program flow.

### 3. Rock Paper Scissors
- A simple interactive console game implementing the rules of Rock Paper Scissors.
- Uses decision-making logic and loops to determine the winner.
- Encourages creativity and interactive programming.

## Skills Learned
- Java basics: variables, loops, conditionals, and user input
- Logical thinking and problem-solving
- Simple game design and interactive applications
- Version control with Git and GitHub
